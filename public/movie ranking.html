<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107943/" target="_blank"><img src="../assets/images/Remains of the Day Movie Poster.jpg" alt="The Remains of the Day Movie Poster" height="150"></a>
<p>This beautiful drama is a subtle, introspective, and poignant unrequited love story, with emotional upheavals that take place in shadows and corners, in secret. It is actually a masterful intertwining of 3 stories.</p>
<p>The film is praised for its writing, cinematography, score, and directing, and is considered one of the best movies of the last several decades. It was a critical and box office success and it was nominated for eight Academy Awards.</p>

<h3>Jean de Florette</h3>
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091288/" target="_blank"><img src="../assets/images/Jean de Florette Movie Poster.jpg" alt="Jean de Florette Movie Poster" height="150"></a>
<p> This beautiful 1986 French period drama film, directed by Claude Berri, is based on a novel by Marcel Pagnol. It is followed by the film "Manon des Sources". </p>
<p>The story takes place in rural Provence, where two local farmers plot to trick a newcomer out of his newly inherited property. It is a beautiful exploration of human character and exposes in particular the relentlessness of human greed.</p>
<p>At the time the most expensive French film ever made, it was a great commercial and critical success, both domestically and internationally, and was nominated for eight CÃ©sar awards, and 10 BAFTAs.</p>

<h3>Shadowlands</h3>
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108101/" target="_blank"><img src="../assets/images/Shadowlands Movie Poster.jpg" alt="Shadowlands Movie Poster" height="150"></a>
<p>An intelligent, moving and beautifully acted British biographical drama film about the relationship between academic C.S. Lewis (played by Anthony Hopkins) and Jewish American poet Joy Gresham (played by Debra Winger), her death from cancer, and how this challenged his Christianity. This is a rare tearjerker that rejects manipulation at every level, instead relying upon narrative and character.</p>
<p>The film won the 1993 BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Film.</p>
